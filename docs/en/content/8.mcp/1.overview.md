# AgentKit MCP

AgentKit MCP provides a unified MCP gateway and tool governance hub. Through shared instances, pre-built authentication plugins, and automatic search capabilities, it lowers the barrier to entry, reduces token costs, improves tool hit rates and reliability—allowing teams to focus on business logic and user experience refinement.

**Core Positioning:** Unified entry point, low-barrier access, and a governable tool ecosystem. It handles MCP access and session persistence, combined with OAuth2 and API-Key authentication plugins, as well as cross-tool semantic search capabilities, forming an engineering backbone that is "easy to integrate, governable, and low-cost."

## AgentKit MCP Features

AgentKit MCP mainly includes MCP Services and MCP Toolsets.

### MCP Services

Supports quickly bringing enterprise existing Web/HTTP services and third-party interfaces into Agents. AgentKit supports two paths:

1. **Direct MCP Server forwarding** – For backends that already have MCP capabilities
2. **HTTP-to-MCP conversion** – Upload Swagger definitions and rule validations to automatically generate tools and parameter descriptions, allowing historical assets to quickly enter the MCP capability set

**Applicable Scenarios:**

- Targeting specific backends (MCP Server or HTTP)
- Providing access domains and session persistence
- Authentication pre-configured at the service level (API-Key, OAuth)
- Suitable for scenarios with controllable and well-defined tool scale

### MCP Toolsets

As the number of tools grows or when clients have tool limits (e.g., Trae supports up to 50 tools), automatic search condenses the exposure of the "full tool set" to the LLM into two encapsulated tools: `search` and `use`. Vector retrieval selects high-match tools, reducing context redundancy and latency while improving call accuracy.

**Applicable Scenarios:**

- Combining tool collections from multiple MCP services
- Selecting optimal tools through semantic retrieval
- Exposing only two tools, `search` and `use`, to the LLM
- Suitable for scenarios with large tool quantities or client tool limits

### Authentication & Security

AgentKit MCP authentication primarily adopts the **OAuth2 Client Credentials** pattern, suitable for frontend applications accessing Agent runtime, server-side tasks accessing Agent runtime, and Agents accessing MCP Servers. It also provides API-Key as a low-dependency alternative, with rotation and hosting planned for future releases.

**Authentication Mode Distinctions:**

- **Inbound:** Agent and MCP inbound authentication (OAuth2, API-Key), refined to individual authorization codes and client credentials
- **Outbound:** Gateway credential pass-through or transformation when accessing MCP Servers (API-Key, OAuth client)
