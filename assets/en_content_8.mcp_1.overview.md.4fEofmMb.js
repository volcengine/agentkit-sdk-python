Through shared instances, pre-built authentication plugins, and automatic search capabilities, it lowers the barrier to entry, reduces token costs, improves tool hit rates and reliability—allowing teams to focus on business logic and user experience refinement.</p><p><strong>Core Positioning:</strong> Unified entry point, low-barrier access, and a governable tool ecosystem. It handles MCP access and session persistence, combined with OAuth2 and API-Key authentication plugins, as well as cross-tool semantic search capabilities, forming an engineering backbone that is &quot;easy to integrate, governable, and low-cost.&quot;</p><h2 id="agentkit-mcp-features" tabindex="-1">AgentKit MCP Features <a class="header-anchor" href="#agentkit-mcp-features" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;AgentKit MCP Features&quot;">​</a></h2><p>AgentKit MCP mainly includes MCP Services and MCP Toolsets.</p><h3 id="mcp-services" tabindex="-1">MCP Services <a class="header-anchor" href="#mcp-services" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;MCP Services&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Supports quickly bringing enterprise existing Web/HTTP services and third-party interfaces into Agents.
